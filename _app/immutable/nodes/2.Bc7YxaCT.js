			My professional journey has provided me with diverse experiences in software development, machine learning and artificial 
			intelligence. I am eager to pursue graduate studies in AI domain and aspire to contribute to advancements in AI through research and development.</p> <p>Currently, at Mercantile Cloud, I focus on Document Extraction using Machine Learning and built QnA systems with large language models. 
			Additionally, I developed cloud services using AWS and Azure, which involved creating Lambda functions and integrating them with other services for an application.
		   These experiences deepened my expertise in machine learning and cloud computing, enhancing my ability to solve complex problems.</p> <p>At KonnectCraft, I contributed to the enhancement of an application built in React and Django and
		am involved in developing the next version of the front-end using Next.js. My work on integrating deep learning models
		using Transfer Learning and Image Classification with mobile application has solidified my foundation in software development
		methodologies and AI technologies.</p> <p>I am passionate about utilizing machine learning techniques to create practical and impactful solutions. My projects, 
		such as the Personalized LLM and Post Classification System, reflect my ability to apply machine learning and software 
		development techniques to real-world applications. With a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and core computer 
		science subjects, I am committed to growing, researching, and building innovative solutions in the AI domain.</p></div>`;return{c(){e=r("meta"),i=f(),t=r("section"),t.innerHTML=l,this.h()},l(n){const a=v("svelte-t32ptj",document.head);e=c(a,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),a.forEach(o),i=y(n),t=c(n,"SECTION",{"data-svelte-h":!0}),x(t)!=="svelte-ruwx3j"&&(t.innerHTML=l),this.h()},h(){document.title="Home",d(e,"name","description"),d(e,"content","Svelte demo app")},m(n,a){b(document.head,e),m(n,i,a),m(n,t,a)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(n){n&&(o(i),o(t)),o(e)}}}class M extends h{constructor(e){super(),g(this,e,null,_,u,{})}}export{M as component,A as universal};
